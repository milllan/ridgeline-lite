**[Upgrade to Ridgeline Pro →](https://payhip.com/b/GkIRJ)** · [Live demo](https://ridgeline-roofing-demo.vercel.app)

## Quick start

```bash
# Requires Node 22.12+
npm install
npm run dev        # → http://localhost:4321
npm run build      # static output in ./dist
```

## Customize

1. **Company info** — edit `src/config/site.ts` (name, phone, address,
   hours, badges, form backend, theme). Every page reads from it.
2. **Domain** — set `site` in `astro.config.mjs` and the sitemap URL in
   `public/robots.txt`.
3. **Services** — edit the MDX files in `src/content/services/`.
4. **Reviews** — edit `src/content/reviews.json` (the aggregate score is
   computed).
5. **Images** — replace the photos in `src/assets/` with your own work.
6. **Forms** — create a free [Formspree](https://formspree.io) form and
   paste its endpoint into `formEndpoint` in `site.ts`; or set
   `formProvider: 'netlify'` when hosting on Netlify.

## Deploy

Static output, zero config on all major hosts — build command
`npm run build`, output directory `dist`:

- **Vercel** — import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
- **Netlify** — import at [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
